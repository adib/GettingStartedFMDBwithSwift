# Getting Started with FMDB and Swift

This project demonstrates using the Swift programming language to use SQLite databases through the [FMDB library](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb).
It provides sample statements to create tables, insert rows, update rows, and query rows.


Everything is inside file `GettingStartedFMDBwithSwiftTests.swift`.
The application target serves only as a placeholder.


The demonstration is organized as unit tests. Thus, you can run each demonstration independently.
Each unit test run will create a new database file within `GettingStartedWithFMDBandSwift` inside the _application support_ directory.
